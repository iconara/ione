_If you're reading this on GitHub, please note that this is the readme for the development version and that some features described here might not yet have been released. You can find the readme for a specific version either through [rubydoc.info](http://rubydoc.info/find/gems?q=ione) or via the release tags ([here is an example](https://github.com/iconara/ione/tree/v1.2.0))._

Ione is a framework for reactive programming in Ruby. It is based on the reactive core of [cql-rb](http://github.com/iconara/cql-rb), the Ruby driver for Cassandra.

# Features

## Futures & promises

At the core of Ione is a futures API. Futures make it easy to compose asynchronous operations.

## Evented IO

A key piece of the framework is an IO reactor with which you can easily build network clients and servers.

### Byte buffer

Networking usually means pushing lots of bytes around and in Ruby it's easy to make the mistake of using strings as buffers. Ione provides an efficient byte buffer implementation as an alternative.

# Examples

The [examples](https://github.com/iconara/ione/tree/master/examples) directory has some examples of what you can do with Ione, for example:

* [redis_client](https://github.com/iconara/ione/tree/master/examples/redis_client) is a more or less full featured Redis client that uses most of Ione's features.
* [http_client](https://github.com/iconara/ione/tree/master/examples/http_client) is a simplistic HTTP client that uses Ione and [http_parser.rb](http://rubygems.org/gems/http_parser.rb) to make HTTP GET request. It also shows how to make TLS connections, and how to provide a thread pool for callbacks.
* [cql-rb](https://github.com/iconara/cql-rb) is a high performance Cassandra driver and where Ione was originally developed.
* [cassandra-driver](https://github.com/datastax/ruby-driver) is the successor to cql-rb.
* [ione-rpc](https://github.com/iconara/ione-rpc) is a RPC framework built on Ione. It makes it reasonably easy to build networked applications without having to reinvent the wheel.
