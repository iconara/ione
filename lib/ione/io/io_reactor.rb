    # An IO reactor takes care of all the IO for a client. It handles opening
    # new connections, and making sure that connections that have data to send
    # flush to the network, and connections that have data coming in read that
    # data and delegate it to their protocol handlers.
    #
    # All IO is done in a single background thread, regardless of how many
    # connections you open. There shouldn't be any problems handling hundreds of
    # connections if needed. All operations are thread safe, but you should take
    # great care when in your protocol handlers to make sure that they don't
    # do too much work in their data handling callbacks, since those will be
    # run in the reactor thread, and every cycle you use there is a cycle which
    # can't be used to handle IO.
    #
    # The IO reactor is completely protocol agnostic, and it's up to you to
    # create objects that can interpret the bytes received from remote hosts,
    # and to send the correct commands back. The way this works is that when you
    # open a connection you can provide a protocol handler factory as a block,
    # (or you can simply wrap the returned connection). This factory can be used
    # to create objects that wrap the raw connections and register to receive
    # new data, and it can write data to connection. It can also register to be
    # notified when the socket is closed, or it can itself close the socket.
    #
    # @example A protocol handler that processes whole lines
    #   io_reactor.connect('example.com', 6543, 10) do |connection|
    #     LineProtocolHandler.new(connection)
    #   end
    #
    #   # ...
    #
    #   class LineProtocolHandler
    #     def initialize(connection)
    #       @connection = connection
    #       # register a listener method for new data, this must be done in the
    #       # in the constructor, and only one listener can be registered
    #       @connection.on_data(&method(:process_data))
    #       @buffer = ''
    #     end
    #
    #     def process_data(new_data)
    #       # in this fictional protocol we want to process whole lines, so we
    #       # append new data to our buffer and then loop as long as there is
    #       # a newline in the buffer, everything up until a newline is a
    #       # complete line
    #       @buffer << new_data
    #       while newline_index = @buffer.index("\n")
    #         line = @buffer.slice!(0, newline_index + 1)
    #         line.chomp!
    #         # Now do something interesting with the line, but remember that
    #         # while you're in the data listener method you're executing in the
    #         # IO reactor thread so you're blocking the reactor from doing
    #         # other IO work. You should not do any heavy lifting here, but
    #         # instead hand off the data to your application's other threads.
    #         # One way of doing that is to create a Ione::Future in the method
    #         # that sends the request, and then complete the future in this
    #         # method. How you keep track of which future belongs to which
    #         # reply is very protocol dependent so you'll have to figure that
    #         # out yourself.
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    #     def send_request(command_string)
    #       # This example primarily shows how to implement a data listener
    #       # method, but this is how you write data to the connection. The
    #       # method can be called anything, it doesn't have to be #send_request
    #       @connection.write(command_string)
    #       # The connection object itself is threadsafe, but to create any
    #       # interesting protocol you probably need to set up some state for
    #       # each request so that you know which request to complete when you
    #       # get data back.
