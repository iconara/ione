  # A byte buffer is a more efficient way of working with bytes than using
  # a regular Ruby string. It also has convenient methods for reading integers
  # shorts and single bytes that are faster than `String#unpack`.
  #
  # When you use a string as a buffer, by adding to the end and taking away
  # from the beginning, Ruby will continue to grow the backing array of
  # characters. This means that the longer you use the string the worse the
  # performance will get and the more memory you waste.
  #
  # {ByteBuffer} solves the problem by using two strings: one is the read
  # buffer and one is the write buffer. Writes go to the write buffer only,
  # and reads read from the read buffer until it is empty, then a new write
  # buffer is created and the old write buffer becomes the new read buffer.
  #
